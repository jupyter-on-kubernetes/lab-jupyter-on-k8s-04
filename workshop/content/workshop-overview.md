This is the fourth workshop exploring the options for deploying Jupyter notebooks to Kubernetes. The prior workshops covered how to run a Jupyter notebook locally and within a container in Kubernetes. The workshops also explored using an operator to manage the deployment of a Jupyter notebook, as well as using JupyterHub.

In this workshop we are going to revisit deploying single Jupyter notebook instances to Kubernetes. Rather than use raw Kubernetes resources, this time we will use the Carvel tools to create a set of resource templates for deploying a Jupyter notebook.
