To verify the environment is set up correctly, run:

```execute
kubectl auth can-i create pods
```

Did you type the command in yourself? If you did, click on the command instead and you will find that it is executed for you. You can click on any command which has the <span class="fas fa-running"></span> icon shown to the right of it, and it will be copied to the interactive terminal and run. If you would rather make a copy of the command so you can paste it to another window, hold down the shift key when you click on the command.

If the command above outputs ``yes``, you are all good to go.

If at any time while doing the workshop, the terminals loose connectivity and show as being **Closed**, with the <span class="fas fa-sync-alt"></span> sync icon top right showing as red, click on the sync button to reconnect.
